We started writing The Orbital Index as a way to share some of the most interesting articles and resources we kept running across while pursuing our personal interests in space and space startups. We ended up sharing a lot of these on a Slack channel we were both part of and eventually ended up collaborating to write the [newsletter](/archive/) you're now (hopefully) reading each week.

You can find us in a bunch other places as well:
